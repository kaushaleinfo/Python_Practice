Now talking about escape sequences
An escape sequence character is a backslash '\ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of a character that cannot be directly used in a string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

'''

#print("This doesnt "execute") # it will throw an error 
print("This will \"execute\" ")
